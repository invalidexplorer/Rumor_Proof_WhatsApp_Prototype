**Prototype for a whatsapp anti-rumour application**

This is a prototype to illustrate how we can flag viral rumour messages in WhatsApp
it works by building an array of linklist where each linklist contains the main message and
the nodes contain the list of senders and receivers who have sent this message.

The messages here are a unique ID that is given to the original WhatsApp encrypted message
since we are using the encrypted message's unique ID instead of the message, the privacy isn't compromised

After the message has been flagged, the next function takes place in the mobile of the receiver, 
Before encrypting the message we check that the unique ID generated by the encrypted message is the same as the flagged ID
If it is then the message is not encrypted and is sent to a moderator, since the message has been accessed by 400+ people already, privacy shouldn't be an issue here

If the message is found to be a rumour, all the people that have received this message are notified since their phone numbers are available in the link list of the message. Further, we can also trace back the message to its creator and then report him/her for further action.
